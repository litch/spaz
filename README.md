# spaz

This plugin will add some (optional) stochastic behavior to a CLN  node.

Upon starting, it's a regular old node (so it will behave well in conformance testing).

- [x] Disconnect peer
- [x] Send some funds
- [] Close any duplicate channels it has (maybe force)
- [] Open a channel to a random peer
